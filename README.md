Git repo for intermediate JS of Waseda University

## About the project

Utilize API services to create a Javascript project. This project will be using a openAI API. Purpose is to create a simple chatbot application for travel planning.
However, we are trying to create an application that takes one additional step than ChatGPT. Using NLP libraries we are trying to use TF-IDF to extract keywords from the User's Input. Then pass it into Google CSE to retrieve links related to the keyword. Or build a url that can scrape skyscanner or airbnb websites. With the scraped text, we are intending to feed it back into the openAI API to retrieve a summary of those websites. So that, as new bing can do, it can provide a reference link to the User.
